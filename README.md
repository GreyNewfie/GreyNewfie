# Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Danny Simms!

## I'm an aspiring full stack software developer from St. John's, Newfoundland

### ðŸ¤” About me

I've always had a deep interest in technology, and two years ago, I joined the tech sector as an account manager. This experience ignited
a desire to deepen my technical skills, leading me to explore web development and coding in my spare time. Creating projects and continuously 
learning affirmed my passion for building software, driving me to pursue a full career change into software development. I'm currently completing 
the [Get Building](https://get-building.ca/) program where I've completed two projects, Hero's Log and WizPool. I'm currently working on finishing 
the program and expanding my backend skills with NodeJS and SQL. Below, you'll find details on the projects Iâ€™ve built and the technologies Iâ€™ve
worked with.
