### ðŸ¤” About me

I'm an account manager with the goal of becoming a software developer. I started working in the tech sector 2 years ago,
and it inspired me to pursue a more technical role and a career change. I began exploring and learning more about web development and 
coding in my spare time. I enjoyed creating and learning new things so much I decided to take it more seriously pursue my lifelong passion
for technology. I'm currently enrolled in the [Get Coding](https://www.getcoding.ca/) program and have pusblised my first project Hero's Log,
a character and quest tracking app for players of the board game HeroQuest.
