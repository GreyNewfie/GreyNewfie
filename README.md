# Hey 👋, I'm Danny Simms!

## I'm an aspiring full stack software developer from St. John's, Newfoundland

### 🤔 About me

I've always harbored an interest and passion for technology. Over two years ago I joined the tech sector as an account manager, 
and this experience inspired me to pursue expanding my technical skills. I began exploring web development and 
coding in my spare time, and it quickly affirmed how much I enjoy creating and learning new things. This excitement drove me to take 
my passion more seriously. and pursue a career change. I'm currently enrolled in the [Get Coding](https://www.getcoding.ca/) program 
and have completed two projects, Hero's Log and WizPool. I'm currently working on finishing the last module of the program and learning more
about backend development using NodeJS and SQL. Below you'll see more about the projects I've built and the technologies I've work with.
